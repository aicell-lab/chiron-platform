# Tabula Platform

A foundation model platform for single-cell transcriptomics with privacy-preserving federated learning.

</div>

## 🎯 Overview

Tabula Platform is a cutting-edge solution for handling single-cell transcriptomics data at scale while preserving privacy through federated learning. The platform provides:

- 🔒 **Privacy-First Architecture**: Train models across multiple institutions without sharing raw data
- 📊 **Tabular Data Modeling**: Specialized handling of unordered single-cell data structure
- 🧬 **Biological Context**: Novel pretraining strategies capturing regulatory logic across diverse biological systems
- 🔄 **Robust Integration**: Support for cell type annotation, gene imputation, and multi-omics integration

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- pnpm (v8 or higher)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/tabula-platform.git
